4.4 Final Integration
Overview
The third and final level involved merging the elemental ontology framework with the perspectivisation enhancements into a cohesive whole. This integration ensures that the ontology not only captures core educational concepts but also represents the complex interplay of perspectives that shape educational systems.
Key Achievements
The integration successfully established a comprehensive ontological structure with two primary outcomes:
Unified Ontology Architecture
The integrated architecture seamlessly combines both dimensional aspects of educational systems:

Core educational concepts remain clearly structured, maintaining the essential distinction between free and paid educational systems while preserving crucial relationships like choosesEducationalPath and deliversContent
Perspectivisation elements are fully incorporated, including the implementation of external and internal viewpoints as disjoint classes and integration of attitude classifications
The relationship between educational providers and learners is enriched with perspective-based properties, enabling deeper analysis of educational dynamics

Enhanced Query Capabilities
The integration enables sophisticated querying that supports:

Multi-dimensional analysis of how different demographics perceive educational systems
Tracking of attitude formation and evolution across different educational contexts
Investigation of stereotype impact on educational perception
Documentation of perspective shifts over time

Validation
The integration's success was verified through competency questions, with SPARQL queries successfully retrieving information about:

Perspective differences between stakeholders in educational systems
Attitude patterns across different educational formats
Factors influencing changes in educational perception
The relationship between educational costs and societal attitudes

4.5 Further Development
Extended Demographic Integration
Building on the successful integration of core concepts, we have identified opportunities for extending the ontology to capture broader demographic perspectives. This extension would enhance our understanding of how educational attitudes transcend traditional demographic boundaries.
Proposed Enhancements
Age-Based Analysis Extension
We propose expanding the current demographic model to include:

Additional age-related properties for finer-grained analysis
New classes for capturing generational perspectives on education
Enhanced relationships between age groups and educational preferences

Attitude Evolution Tracking
The extended framework would support:

Long-term tracking of attitude changes toward educational systems
Analysis of how demographic shifts influence educational preferences
Documentation of evolving perspectives on educational value

Implementation Approach
To realize these enhancements, we have developed:

Enhanced demographic classification properties
Additional competency questions focused on age-based analysis
Extended SPARQL queries for multi-generational perspective analysis

Example competency question:
"Which individuals over a certain age have a positive attitude towards specific educational systems?"
This development direction would provide richer insights into how educational perspectives evolve across different age groups and demographic segments, offering valuable data for educational policy and planning.
