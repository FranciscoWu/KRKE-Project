# 6. Conclusions

This project has successfully developed a comprehensive ontology for analyzing educational systems through the lens of perspectives and attitudes. Through a systematic multi-level modeling approach, we created a framework that captures both the structural elements of educational systems and the complex web of perspectives that shape their perception and evaluation.

At the foundational level, our ontology established the core concepts essential to understanding educational systems, distinguishing between paid and free educational pathways while mapping their relationships with learners, content, and outcomes. This base structure provided the necessary scaffolding for representing the fundamental aspects of educational delivery and participation.

The integration of perspectivisation elements in the second level marked a significant advancement in our ability to model educational dynamics. By incorporating concepts from Aldo Gangemi's PERSPECTIVISATION ontology, we enhanced our framework to capture:

- The interplay between external and internal viewpoints on educational systems
- The evolution of attitudes and their influence on educational choices
- The role of stereotypes and societal perceptions in shaping educational experiences
- The mechanisms of perspective shifts and their impact on educational outcomes

The final integration phase successfully merged these elements into a cohesive whole, creating a unified ontology capable of representing both structural and perceptual aspects of educational systems. This was validated through a series of competency questions and SPARQL queries, demonstrating the ontology's ability to:

1. Track and analyze different viewpoints on educational systems
2. Map the distribution of attitudes across various educational contexts
3. Identify factors influencing both positive and negative perceptions
4. Document the evolution of perspectives over time

The practical implementation, tested through GraphDB and validated using real-world instances, confirmed the ontology's robustness and utility. Our framework successfully modeled complex scenarios involving multiple stakeholders, diverse educational pathways, and evolving perspectives, providing valuable insights into how different educational systems are perceived and valued.

Looking forward, this ontology provides a foundation for:

- Evidence-based educational policy development
- Analysis of educational system effectiveness across different contexts
- Understanding the role of perception in educational choice and outcomes
- Supporting decision-making in educational planning and reform

The project's success in modeling both structural and perceptual aspects of educational systems opens new avenues for research and practical applications. By providing a formal framework for representing and analyzing educational perspectives, we contribute to the broader field of educational research and support more informed decision-making in educational policy and planning.

This work also demonstrates the value of integrating perspectivisation concepts into domain ontologies, offering a model for similar applications in other fields where stakeholder perspectives and attitudes play crucial roles in system dynamics and outcomes.

Ultimately, this ontology serves not only as a technical achievement in knowledge representation but also as a practical tool for understanding and improving educational systems through a more nuanced understanding of how they are perceived and experienced by different stakeholders.
