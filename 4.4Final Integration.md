4.4 Final Integration
**Overview**
The third and final level involved merging the elemental ontology framework with the perspectivisation enhancements into a cohesive whole. This integration ensures that the ontology not only captures core educational concepts but also represents the complex interplay of perspectives that shape educational systems.

**Key Achievements**
The integration successfully established a comprehensive ontological structure with two primary outcomes:
Unified Ontology Architecture
The integrated architecture seamlessly combines both dimensional aspects of educational systems:

Core educational concepts remain clearly structured, maintaining the essential distinction between free and paid educational systems while preserving crucial relationships like choosesEducationalPath and deliversContent
Perspectivisation elements are fully incorporated, including the implementation of external and internal viewpoints as disjoint classes and integration of attitude classifications
The relationship between educational providers and learners is enriched with perspective-based properties, enabling deeper analysis of educational dynamics

**Enhanced Query Capabilities**
The integration enables sophisticated querying that supports:

Multi-dimensional analysis of how different demographics perceive educational systems
Tracking of attitude formation and evolution across different educational contexts
Investigation of stereotype impact on educational perception
Documentation of perspective shifts over time

**Validation**
The integration's success was verified through competency questions, with SPARQL queries successfully retrieving information about:

Perspective differences between stakeholders in educational systems
Attitude patterns across different educational formats
Factors influencing changes in educational perception
The relationship between educational costs and societal attitudes
