# 5.2 Knowledge Graph

### Overview

The educational system ontology was transformed into a comprehensive knowledge graph through careful integration of populated data with the ontological structure. This process involved a systematic approach utilizing both Protégé for ontological development and reasoning, and GraphDB for advanced querying and validation.

### Technical Implementation Process

The knowledge graph development followed a carefully structured two-stage technical implementation:

#### Stage 1: Protégé Implementation
We began with Protégé for initial ontology development and validation, which included:
- Development of the complete class hierarchy and property definitions
- Implementation of object and data properties with appropriate restrictions
- Validation using the HermiT reasoner to ensure ontological consistency
- Classification verification and logical constraint checking
- Population of initial instances for preliminary testing
- Debugging of any inconsistencies identified during reasoning

#### Stage 2: GraphDB Implementation
Following successful validation in Protégé, we migrated to GraphDB for advanced querying capabilities:
- Transfer of the validated ontology to GraphDB
- Development of complex SPARQL queries for competency question validation
- Implementation of visualization tools for result analysis
- Optimization of query performance for complex relationship analysis

### Query Validation Results

The following queries demonstrate the knowledge graph's capability to capture and analyze educational perspectives:

#### Query 1: External Viewpoint Analysis
This query identified learners with external viewpoints on educational systems:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?viewpoint
WHERE {
    ?person rdf:type edu:Learner .
    ?person edu:hasViewpoint edu:ExternalViewpoint .
}
```

Results Analysis:
The query revealed 26 distinct instances of learners with external perspectives, validating our ontology's comprehensive coverage of diverse stakeholder viewpoints. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our perspective modeling approach and confirms the robustness of our class hierarchy design.

#### Query 2: Negative Attitudes in Paid Education
```sparql
SELECT ?person
WHERE {
    ?person rdf:type edu:Learner .
    ?person edu:hasAttitude edu:NegativeAttitude .
    ?paidSystem rdf:type edu:PaidEducationSystem .
    ?person edu:choosesEducationalPath ?paidSystem .
}
```

Results Analysis:
The query successfully identified specific instances of negative attitudes within paid educational contexts, highlighting patterns related to cost concerns and accessibility issues. This demonstrates our ontology's capability to capture nuanced emotional responses to educational choices.

#### Query 3 & 4: Influence Analysis 
```sparql
SELECT ?system ?influence ?content
WHERE {
    ?system rdf:type edu:EducationalSystem .
    ?system edu:hasInfluencingFactors ?influence .
    ?influence edu:influences edu:NegativeAttitude .
    ?influence edu:hasContent ?content .
}
```
[query3.jpg]
[query4.jpg]

Results Analysis:
The influence analysis revealed multiple factors affecting negative perceptions, with particular emphasis on resource constraints and funding issues. This granular analysis helps identify systemic challenges within educational systems and validates our ontology's ability to capture complex causal relationships.

#### Query 5 & 6: Perspective Shift Analysis
```sparql
SELECT ?system ?perspectiveShift ?content
WHERE {
    ?system rdf:type edu:EducationalSystem .
    ?system edu:hasPerspectiveShift ?perspectiveShift .
    ?perspectiveShift edu:hasContent ?content .
}
```
[query5.jpg]
[query6.jpg]

Results Analysis:
The perspective shift analysis demonstrated our ontology's ability to track the evolution of perceptions over time, showing how attitudes transform based on experiences and outcomes. This temporal dimension adds crucial insight into the dynamic nature of educational perspectives.

#### Query 7: Attitude Distribution Analysis
```sparql
SELECT ?freeSystem ?participant ?attitude
WHERE {
    ?freeSystem rdf:type edu:FreeEducationSystem .
    ?participant rdf:type edu:Learner .
    ?participant edu:choosesEducationalPath ?freeSystem .
    ?participant edu:hasAttitude ?attitude .
}
```
[query7.jpg]

Results Analysis:
The query revealed comprehensive mapping of attitudes across various free educational institutions, showing patterns in attitude distribution based on institutional type and geographical location. This validates our ontology's ability to represent diverse educational contexts and their associated perspectives.

### Validation Outcomes

The combination of Protégé's reasoning capabilities and GraphDB's query functionalities demonstrated that our knowledge graph successfully:
1. Maintains logical consistency across all defined relationships
2. Captures complex relationships between educational systems and stakeholder perspectives
3. Supports inference of implicit relationships through reasoning
4. Enables detailed analysis of perspective patterns and trends
5. Provides a robust foundation for educational system analysis

### Conclusion

The successful implementation and validation through both Protégé and GraphDB demonstrates the robustness of our ontological framework. The dual-platform approach leveraged the strengths of both tools, ensuring both logical consistency and powerful query capabilities. The results validate our ontology's effectiveness in capturing both structural and perceptual aspects of educational systems, providing a solid foundation for further analysis and research in educational dynamics.
