### **New Classes and Properties**

#### **Overview**
The second-level modeling refines the elemental ontology by integrating Aldo Gangemi's PERSPECTIVISATION ontology. Key classes and properties such as **Background**, **Cut**, **Lens**, **Eventuality**, and **Attitude** are added to represent multiple viewpoints and the dynamic nature of identity and perception in youth subcultures. 

The ontology uses **punning** to allow elements like **viewpoints** and **attitudes** to function as both abstract classes and specific instances, supporting both theoretical analysis (intensional reasoning) and practical applications (extensional use).

### **Classes**

- **ExternalViewpoint**:  
  Represents perspectives of non-participants in a subculture.  
  *Disjoint with InternalViewpoint.*

- **InternalViewpoint**:  
  Represents the self-perception of subculture members, including their identity and interpretation of their place within the subculture.

- **Influence**:  
  Covers factors affecting interpretations of subcultures, such as media, social institutions, education, and cultural trends. Includes Hall's Encoding/Decoding theory.

- **PerspectiveShift**:  
  Captures evolving attitudes, stereotypes, and self-perceptions of subcultures over time and across contexts.

- **Stereotype**:  
  Generalizations about subcultures, based on Cardwellâ€™s definition. Includes societal misrepresentations and biases shaping public discourse.

- **PositiveAttitude / NegativeAttitude / NeutralAttitude**:  
  Represents evaluative stances toward subcultures:  
    - *Positive*: Aligns with moral values.  
    - *Negative*: Often linked to stereotypes.  
    - *Neutral*: A mix of positive and negative.

### **Properties**

- **hasViewpoint**:  
  Links a person to an Internal/External viewpoint.  
  *Inverse: isViewpointOf.*

- **hasAttitude**:  
  Connects a person to Positive/Negative/Neutral attitudes.  
  *Inverse: isAttitudeOf.*

- **influencedBy**:  
  Links attitudes to their influences.  
  *Inverse: influences.*

- **triggersStereotype**:  
  Links subcultures to stereotypes.

- **isCharacterisedBy**:  
  Links viewpoints to the perspective shifts they determine. 

- **expressedVia**:  
  Denotes attitudes shaped by stereotypes or values.  
  *Inverse: expresses.*

- **determines**:  
  Links viewpoints to specific attitudes.

- **hasPerceptionOf**:  
  Connects non-participants to subcultures.

- **hasInfluencingFactors**:  
  Links subcultures to influencing factors.

- **hasPerspectiveShift**:  
  Relates subcultures to perspective shifts.

### **Significance**
This refined ontology provides a richer representation of youth subcultures by modeling their dynamic identity and societal perceptions. It enables nuanced analysis of stereotypes, attitudes, and influences, bridging theoretical and practical applications.
